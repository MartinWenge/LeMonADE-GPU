/*
 - n = 108 is the number of allowed bonds
 - naive implementation: try out all 2^108 combinations
 - optimization 1: instead of iterating over ALL combinations, iterate only
   over the next bond if it is indeed allowed by volume exclusion.
    => Will result in <=2^m combinations with m~20 = maximum neighbors
 - implementation: Count up a vector of length <= m with it's elements bounded
   by 108,107, ... or smaller if already end. Increment first from last, i.e.
   for (0,0,0,0) always the next allowed bond with the smallest index will
   be used! => seems easy to implement and easy enough it could work
 - optimization 2: create lookup table for volume exclusion which stores
   which bonds j become forbidden when adding bond i:
   i\j 0 1 2 3  => bond 0 forbids 0,2,3, bond 1 only forbids itself
    0  1 0 1 1  this table is symmetrical, suffices to store one half i<j and
    1  0 1 0 0  the diagonal obviousky also is always 1
    2  1 0 1 0
    3  1 0 0 1
 - estimation upper bound: Max bond length in one dimension is 3
   => upper bound for volume is 7^3 = 343.
   The densest filling with valid volume exclusion in 1D is 50%, in 2D it's
   25%, in 3D its 12.5% (1 in 8)
   => maximum bound by volume exclusion is 343/8 = 42.87 < 108. Knowing that
   one is at the center we could try to be more exact, but that's too complex
 - idea: high-dimensional probing => Monte-Carlo based findMaximum method
     => works wonderfully well :3
 - optimization 3: Order does not matter, so require at each step, that bondIDs
   are sorted / increasing! With 20 neighbors maximum this would give an upper
   bound of operations to do as 108!/[(108-20)!20!] = choose(108,20) = 2.9e21
   The observer for the version with 1/20! missing already seemed much faster.
   A more realistic estimate would be to change the 108!/88! = 108!*...89! such
   that the last is not 89!, but 1! and the rest is evenly spaced, i.e.
   108/20=5.4 ~> 108!103!*...*1! <- 20 factors =>
       import math, numpy as np
       np.product( np.arange(1,108,5.4) ) / math.factorial(20)
     => 7 742 713 855 154.2754 = 7.7e12, should be very well doable!
 - optimization 4: Because of how the bond vectors were created from permutation
   sets, the problem is highly symmetrical which could be used to reduce problem
   size, then again a asymmetrical solution might be the best, or can't it?
 - optimization 5: sort bonds by amount of other bonds they forbid, so that the
   "best" bonds are chosen first! This already could be thought of naively as
   THE solution, i.e. following the local maximum to get the global one, but
   that shouldn't be right.
 - optimization 6: increment current index element, instead of all lower ones,
   if nAllowedBondsRemaining + nBondsUsed <= nMaxDegreeAlreadyFound. This is
   better the sooner a very good nMaxDegreeAlreadyFound is found and with
   optimization 5 the currently highest known neighbors (20) are found in the
   very first step.

 * the least amount of bonds, meaning the very first iterations could already
 * give the currently known maximum neighbor estimate of 20, this could reduce
 * the number of tests 10-fold, e.g. for this case:
 *   Bonds used:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11 12 13
 *   Index     :(  0,  0,  0,  4, 11,  0,  5,  0,  0,  1,  0, 0, 2)
 *   Max. free :(108, 94, 80, 66, 51, 33, 27, 19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 4)
 *     => For that index we could already see at bond 11 that this results in
 *        only 7 free choosable bonds after that, meaning upper bound 18 < 20
 *        Therefore we could roughly save 7*4~30x tests!!
